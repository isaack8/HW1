2) In the terminal, type 'jupyter notebook HW1_IsaacK.ipynb'

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

--WHAT THE SHELL SCRIPT DOES--
This script will create a folder called 'HCEPDB', download & unpack a .zip file constaining a .csv file into 
'HCEPDB', and then move the .csv file into the directory containing setup.sh

--WHAT THE JUPYTER NOTEBOOK DOES--
The notebook file contains a number of transformations and operations for the .csv file listed above. Opening it 
will allow you to run these manipulations in a Jupyter notebook


--HOW TO RUN THE SHELL SCRIPT--
1) Make sure the script file, the Jupyter notebook file, and this README are located in the 'HW1' folder
2) Type 'sh setup.sh' in the terminal to run the script
3) The script should then do everything listed above, resulting in a master folder containing the follwing 
files: setup.sh, HW1_IsaacK.ipynb, HCEPDB_moldata.csv, 'HCEPDB', and this README

--HOW TO RUN THE JUPYTER NOTEBOOK--
1) Type 'jupyter notebook HW1_IsaacK.ipynb' in the terminal to open the Jupyter notebook
2) Your browser should open, and since the .csv file unpacked above is in the same directory, the notebook
